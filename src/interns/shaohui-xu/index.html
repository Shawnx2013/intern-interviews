      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>I am a rising senior majoring in Computing Information Technology at Rochester Institute of Technology, I am currently a 
        Cloud Engineering and Service hub co-op at PwC looking for summer internship/co-op opportunities. During my past years of study at RIT,
        I truly enjoyed programming and realized software engineering is the career that I want to pursue in the future. I am not only interested 
        in designing and making various softwares/websites, but also developing software solutions that offer a meaningful and relevant experience
        to its users.
      </p>
      <h1>Internship Goals</h1>
      <p>
        My past experiences had provided an insight on the industry, helped me develop more interests and skills in the field of web development, 
        such as API design and development, frontend UI/UX design. I believe working with Lob will give me a more indepth understanding of web technogies 
        through working with the API products, in addiiton, it will also help further strengthen my abilities as a software engineer. 
        Gaining knowledge and experience is an essential step that one needs to take in becoming a successful software engineer.
